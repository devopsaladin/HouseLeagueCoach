**Step 1: Attendance**
- Mark present/absent players by tapping their names
- Visual indicators show attendance status
- Minimum 5 players required to start

**Step 2: Start Game**
- Tap "Start Game" to enter game mode
- App automatically generates first lineup suggestion

**Step 3: Manage Periods**
- Review suggested lineup with balance metrics
- Accept lineup or generate new suggestion
- Start period to begin tracking time
- Make player swaps by tapping lineup player, then bench player
- Complete period when finished

**Step 4: Monitor Progress**
- **Game Tab**: Current lineup and period management
- **Stats Tab**: Playing time reports and balance metrics
- **Roster Tab**: Quick attendance adjustments

### 3. Key Metrics
- **Playing Time Balance**: Percentage showing how evenly time is distributed
- **Average Skill Level**: Team balance indicator for current lineup
- **Position Balance**: Diversity of positions in lineup

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **TypeScript Types**: Strongly typed data models for players, games, periods
- **LineupGenerator**: Advanced algorithm for optimal lineup creation
- **GameManager**: State management for game flow and player tracking
- **React Navigation**: Tab-based navigation between screens

### Algorithm Details
The lineup generation uses a weighted scoring system:
- **Playing Time (50%)**: Prioritizes players with less court time
- **Position Balance (30%)**: Encourages position diversity
- **Skill Balance (20%)**: Maintains competitive balance

## Customization

### Game Settings
Currently hardcoded but easily configurable in `App.tsx`:
```typescript
const defaultGameSettings: GameSettings = {
  periodsCount: 8,        // Number of regular periods
  periodDuration: 4,      // Minutes per period
  overtimePeriods: 2,     // Additional OT periods available
  playersOnCourt: 5,      // Players per lineup
};
```

### Player Roster
Modify the sample roster in `App.tsx` `createSampleRoster()` function.

## Development
